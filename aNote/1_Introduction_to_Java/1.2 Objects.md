-  An `Object` in java is an instance of any class
- The `Dog` class has its own variables , also knows as instance variables or non-static variables.There must be declared inside the class.
- The method that we created in Dog class **did not have the `static` keyword**. We call such methods **_instance methods_** or **_non-static methods_**.
- To call the `makeNoise` method, we had to first _instantiate_ a `Dog` using the `new` keyword, and then make a specific `Dog` bark. In other words, we called `d.makeNoise()` instead of `Dog.makeNoise()`
- Once an object has been ***instantiated***, it can be _assigned_ to a _declared_ variable of the appropriate type, e.g. `d = new Dog();`
- Variables and methods of a class are also called _members_ of a class.
- Members of a class are accessed using _dot notation_.
## Constructors in Java
We usually construct objects in object oriented languages using a _constructor_:

```
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog(20);
        d.makeNoise();
    }
}
```
Here, the instantiation is parameterized, saving us the time and messiness of manually typing out potentially many instance variable assignments. To enable such syntax, we need only add a "constructor" to our Dog class, as shown below:

```
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds;

    public Dog(int w) {
        weightInPounds = w;
    }

    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds < 10) {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip!");
        } else if (weightInPounds < 30) {
            System.out.println("bark. bark.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("woof!");
        }    
    }
}
```

The constructor with signature `public Dog(int w)` will be invoked anytime that we try to create a `Dog` using the `new` keyword and a single integer parameter.
#### Terminology Summary
#### Array Instantiation, Arrays of Objects

we can create arrays of instantiated objects in Java, e.g.

```
public class DogArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Create an array of two dogs. */
        Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2];
        dogs[0] = new Dog(8);
        dogs[1] = new Dog(20);

        /* Yipping will result, since dogs[0] has weight 8. */
        dogs[0].makeNoise();
    }
}
```

Observe that new is used in two different ways: Once to create an array that can hold two `Dog` objects, and twice to create each actual `Dog`.
## Class Methods vs. Instance Methods

Java allows us to define two types of methods"
- Class methods, a.k.a. static methods
- Instance method, a.k.a. no- static methods
*Instance methods* are actions that can be token only by a specific instnce of a class
*Static methods* are actions that are taken by class itself.

 As an example of a static method, the `Math` class provides a `sqrt` method. Because it is static, we can call it as follows:
```
x = Math.sqrt(100);
```

If `sqrt` had been an instance method, we would have instead the awkward syntax below. Luckily `sqrt` is a static method so we don't have to do this in real programs.
```
Math m = new Math();
x = m.sqrt(100);
```

Sometimes, it makes sense to have a class with both instance and static methods. For example, suppose want the ability to compare two dogs. One way to do this is to add a static method for comparing Dogs.
```
public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
    if (d1.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return d1;
    }
    return d2;
}
```

This method could be invoked by, for example:
```
Dog d = new Dog(15);
Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
Dog.maxDog(d, d2);
```

Observe that we've invoked using the class name, since this method is a static method.

We could also have implemented `maxDog` as a non-static method, e.g.
```
public Dog maxDog(Dog d2) {
    if (this.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return this;
    }
    return d2;
}
```
- **Workflow**:
    - The method checks if the current object's weight (`this.weightInPounds`) is greater than `d2`'s weight.
    - If so, it returns the current object (`this`), indicating that the current object is heavier.
    - Otherwise, it returns `d2`.
- **Reference of `this`**: In this context, `this` refers to the `Dog` object on which the `maxDog` method is called.

Above, we use the keyword `this` to refer to the current object. This method could be invoked, for example, with:
```
Dog d = new Dog(15);
Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
d.maxDog(d2);
```

Here, we invoke the method using a specific instance variable.

**Exercise 1.2.1**: What would the following method do? If you're not sure, try it out.

```
public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
    if (weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return this;
    }
    return d2;
}
```
**Problems**:
- **Static Context Error**: The method is marked as `static`, meaning it's called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class. Therefore, it doesn't have access to instance variables or the `this` reference.
- **`this` Reference Error**: Since it's a static method, using `this` is incorrect because `this` refers to the current object instance, which doesn't exist in a static context.
- **`weightInPounds` Reference Error**: The method attempts to compare `weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds`, but `weightInPounds` is not defined in this static method's scope. It likely intends to compare `d1`'s weight with `d2`'s weight.

#### Static Variables
It is occasionally useful for classes to have static variables. These are properties inherent to the class itself, rather than the instance. For example, we might record that the scientific name (or binomen) for Dogs is "Canis familiaris":

```
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds;
    public static String binomen = "Canis familiaris";
    ...
}
```

Static variables should be accessed using the name of the class rather than a specific instance, e.g. you should use `Dog.binomen`, not `d.binomen`.

While Java technically allows you to access a static variable using an instance name, it is bad style, confusing, and in my opinion an error by the Java designers

**Exercise 1.2.2**: Complete this exercise:
**Question: Will this program compile? If so, what will it print?**
```
public class DogLoop {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Dog smallDog = new Dog(5);
      Dog mediumDog = new Dog(25);
      Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150);
      
      Dog[] manyDogs = new Dog[4];
      manyDogs[0] = smallDog;
      manyDogs[1] = hugeDog;
      manyDogs[2] = new Dog(130);
      
      int i = 0;
      while (i < manyDogs.length) {
         Dog.maxDog(manyDogs[i], mediumDog).makeNoise();
         i = i + 1;
      }
   }
   
   public static class Dog {
      /* Size of the dog in standard dog size units. */
      public int size;

      /* This is a constructor. It tells us how to construct
	 * dogs from our ideal notion of dogness. */

      public Dog(int s) {
         size = s;
      }

      public void makeNoise() {
         if (size < 10) {
            System.out.println("hideous yapping");
         } else if (size < 30) {
            System.out.println("bark!");
         } else {
            System.out.println("woof!");
         }
      }

      /* Return the larger of dog d1 and dog d2. */
      public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
         if (d1.size > d2.size) {
            return d1;
         }
         return d2;
      }   
   }
}
```

## Public static void main(String[] args)

#### Command Line Arguments
Since main is called by the Java interpreter itself rather than another Java class, it is the interpreter's job to supply these arguments. They refer usually to the command line arguments. For example, consider the program `ArgsDemo` below:

```
public class ArgsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

This program prints out the 0th command line argument, e.g.

```
$ java ArgsDemo these are command line arguments
these
```

In the example above, `args` will be an array of Strings, where the entries are {"these", "are", "command", "line", "arguments"}.
